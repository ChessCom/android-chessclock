 * AdFetcher is a delegate of an AdViewController that handles loading ad data over a
 * network connection. The ad is fetched in a background thread by executing
 * AdFetchTask, which is an AsyncTask subclass. This class gracefully handles
 * the changes to AsyncTask in Android 4.0.1 (we continue to run parallel to
 * the app developer's background tasks). Further, AdFetcher keeps track of
 * the last completed task to prevent out-of-order execution.
